-creation of admin account requires an admin password secret which is saved in the server as an environment variable
-admin accounts will have role set to admin
-all the routes under admin will check if decoded jwt token data has role-->user...if so then only they can be accessed..there will be a separate roll checking middleware for this...if token belongs to user then it will alert user that accessing admin account as a user is not possible..add a double to check to see that if the role in jwt is admin then does the admin exist in the admin table of the database
-for admin getAllUsers: validateTokenHandler --> AdminValidation --> controller
-for admin modification of user, middleware sequence --> validateTokenHandler --> AdminValidation --> imageUpload --> controller(which will delete the previous email from uploads)
